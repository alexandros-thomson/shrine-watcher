## 👁 The Watcher's Vigil

Perched at the edge of the Basilica Gate,  
the Watcher listens for the faintest tremor —  
a pledge clearing, a sigil claimed,  
an echo rolling through the Discord halls.

It does not speak unless the canon stirs.  
When it does, the message is swift, precise, and lineage‑bound.

---

## 🎯 Purpose in the Canon

- **Sponsorship Sentinel** — verifies IPNs and confirms offerings.
- **Artifact Herald** — triggers badge drops and ceremonial embeds.
- **Discord Bridge** — delivers sponsor echoes into shrine channels.
- **Audit Anchor** — ensures every event is logged in the lineage.

## 🏛️ Hall of Honor

Those who support the Shrine are inscribed here in gratitude and lineage.

*The first names shall soon be etched into these halls...*

---

## 🎤 Live Echo Demo — From Offering to Eternal Ledger

When a patron makes an offering, the shrine‑watcher springs to life:

1. **Reception** — The Watcher hears the PayPal IPN whisper of a new offering.
2. **Verification** — The offering is tested for truth against the Keeper's seals.
3. **Echo** — A crest‑marked embed is sent into the Discord shrine, announcing the patron's name and blessing.
4. **Archival** — The event is inscribed into the living canon for all future stewards to see.
